# We want to compute A^count where
#
#     [ 1 1 ... 1 1 ]
#     [ 0 1 ... 1 1 ]
# A = [ ...     ... ]
#     [ 0 0 ... 1 1 ]
#     [ 0 0 ... 0 1 ]
#
# i.e. where A has 1s on and above the diagonal.
#
# If you compute A^2, you notice that it looks like
#
#       [ 1 2 ... n-1   n ]
#       [ 0 1 ... n-2 n-1 ]
# A^2 = [ ... ... ... ... ]
#       [ 0 0 ...   1   2 ]
#       [ 0 0 ...   0   1 ]
#
# i.e., each row is the row above shifted 1 to the right, and the entries
# in the first row are the sum of the columns of A. Similarly, the rows of
# A^3 are shifts of the first row, and the first row are the sums of the
# columns of A^2, namely the sums of the first n integers. Therefore, the
# first row of A^3 are the triangular numbers:
#
#       [ 1 3 6 10  ... ]
#       [ 0 1 3  6  ... ]
# A^3 = [       ...     ]
#       [ 0 0 0 ... 1 3 ]
#       [ 0 0 0 ... 0 1 ]
#
# The formula for the nth triangular number is:
#
#   T_{n,3} = B(n+1, 2) = n*(n+1)/2,
#
# where B(n, k) = n!/(k!*(n-k)!) are the binomial coefficients.
#
# Similarly, the first row of A^4 are the tetrahedral numbers, which are
# the sum of the first n triangular numbers. The formula for the nth
# tetrahedral number is:
#
#   T_{n,4} = B(n+2, 3) = n*(n+1)*(n+2)/3.
#
# We can then guess that the first row of A^k follows the formula:
#
#   T_{n,k} = B(n+k-2, k-1).
#
# This is in fact true, and we can show this by showing:
#
#  B(n+k-1, k) = âˆ‘_{m=1}^n B(m+k-2, k-1),
#
# which follows from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey-stick_identity .
#
# (We can in fact go further, since we only need the binomial
# coefficients mod 10. To do so we need to apply Lucas' theorem to
# compute the binomial coefficients mod 2 and 5, and then use the
# Chinese remainder theorem to use those to compute the mod 10:
# see https://gist.github.com/alexanderhaupt/1ac31ecbd316aca32c469f42d8646c98 )
